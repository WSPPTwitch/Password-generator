# Password-generator
Password will be kept only locally (on your computer). No one has the ability to look into the passwords you generate.
Script made by WSPPTwitch
I will not/do not make profit off of this script in any way.

# REQUIREMENTS:
Python (I personally use 3.13.2)

# INSTALLATION (For begginers)

After installing the script, put the "PasswordGenerator.py" onto your desktop.
Go into CMD (Search Command Prompt in windows search).
Put the following commands in:
1. cd Desktop
2. python PasswordGenerator.py
After inputing all of the commands, the script will start by itself. If you've done all the steps, you will be able to run the script by double-clicking the file.
